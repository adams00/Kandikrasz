## General info

I was inspired by my friends who played flashplayer games in their free time.
I wanted to create a game without flashplayer restrictions such as small display size.
Game that could run well on whatever screen they use without blour.

- Start development server (`npm start`)
- To create production build (`npm run build`)

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development

- Points counter for competing with yourself
- Beautiful images and animations

Issues to be addressed:

- Even with hiDPI library images on scaled browser (150% scale on windows) are not as good
  as without any scaling.
- Player can experience situation when there is no move possible
- Adding levels with some goals required to enter to another level
- Adding Auth to create accounts
- Plug in firebase to store users and their achievements
- Too fast animations on some smaller screens
