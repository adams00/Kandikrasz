## General info

My main motivation to write this game was to show my skills to potential employer.
I was watching my friends from work playing an old Adobe Flash Player games when
they had nothing to do in their work. I stated thinking about creating a game catered to bored
office workers. Game that could be appealing to the eye and with crisp hi-res graphics.
